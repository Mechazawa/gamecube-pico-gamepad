Work in progress gamecube controller USB converter.

The gamecube controller driver is a modified version of the work done by David Pagels on [Retro Pico Switch](https://github.com/DavidPagels/retro-pico-switch)

This project includes [PicoGamepad](https://gitlab.com/realrobots/PicoGamepad) to map the controller input to a USB gamepad device.
